Photo Upload
============

Test for uploading photos from browser or iOS using Meteor

### About

Testing a number of packages, mostly [meteor-photo-uploader](https://github.com/pfafman/meteor-photo-uploader), to allow the uploading of photos from either a desktop browser or iOS mobile safari.  The latter is a little problematic due to the high resolution and handling of orientation via exif.  The package will reduce the size prior to loading it to the server.
